10/17/14:
- moved versions of scons_bm one directory up - releases was never really used


3/27/14:
- removed versions/4  from headers path (this will work on qt4 and qt5)
- adding dl library for linux systems, in fedora the compiler does not add that automatically


3/26/14:
- cleanup and more comments
- geant4 libraries were previously added with LINKFLAGS. This was ok on most systems 
  but in some the wrong library order prevented compilation - LINKFLAGS always comes 
  first in scons no matter what. So now we get the library path and libs still from 
  geant4-config --libs , but we put them in the right scons variables LIBS


3/21/14:
- moving qt4 to site_tools. Users don't need to copy this to system directory anymore. (yay)
